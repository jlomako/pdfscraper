### note to myself about some problems I ran into:
* loading R package "pdftools" resulted in errors -->
 <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/actions/issues/78#issuecomment-611733294">solution</a>: use runner "macos-10.15" and install XQuartz before pdftools is installed: Add <code>run: brew install xquartz --cask</code> to yml file<br>
* GH stopped supporting macos-10.15 this summer, runs on macos-11 now
